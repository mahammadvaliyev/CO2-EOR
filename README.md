# CO2-EOR
Sensitivity study and Assisted History Matching in a shale gas reservoir using CMG.

## Summary

Despite the ongoing investment in renewable energy sources, hydrocarbons are still the major source of
energy. Even if in the future the energy produced from renewable sources will experience a major increase
from current trends, due to energy-intensive nature of the globalized world, those sources, most probably,
will not be able to keep up with the increased demand. This leads to the conclusion that the world is going
to partly rely on hydrocarbons as a source of energy, at least in the near future.

Up to 20% of oil can be extracted from a field under primary production. Another 20-30% of oil can be
produced by application of secondary recovery techniques. This means that there is still at least 50% of
the oil left in underground reservoirs. The oil volume that is left underground after primary and secondary
recovery techniques is usually produced with the aid of EOR techniques. There are a range of EOR
techniques developed and applied to oilfields around the globe with a variable success.

In this work, a comparative study will be presented, where potential performance benefits of CO2 EOR
injection will be evaluated. Being a miscible EOR technique, CO2 injection is one of the most
commercially successful tertiary recovery methods along with thermal methods. The study is based on a
field-scale inverted 5-spot patterned model. Using a field-scale model, the CO2 injection will be simulated
for the last
